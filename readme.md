<b>About the Program</b>

<br>

The MITx Micromasters program in Statistics and Data Science is comprised of four EdX courses and a virtually proctored exam that will provide you with the foundational knowledge essential to understanding the methods and tools used in data science, and hands-on training in data analysis and machine learning. You will dive into the fundamentals of probability and statistics, as well as learn, implement, and experiment with data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. This program will prepare you to become an informed and effective practitioner of data science who adds value to an organization and will also accelerate your path towards an MIT PhD or a Master's at other universities.

Anyone can enroll in the Micromasters program just as in any EdX courses. It is designed for learners who want to acquire sophisticated and rigorous training in data science without leaving their day job but also without compromising quality. There is no application process. To excel in the entire program, make sure you learn the foundational material covered in this course. You will also need some knowledge of matrices and proficiency in Python programming.
